### Overview
The team at Airbnb is trying to increase their profits from their rentals across the US. To do this, they want to explore what factors encourage renters to pay more for a particular listing. Is it the location? Walkability? The property's ratings? 

They want you to provide insights and recommendations by analyzing a dataset containing information on current rental prices, rental locations, and a slew of other details. The team will use your analysis in the future to provide property owners with a suggested price to charge renters. This feature will help hosts (and Airbnb) maximize their profits from each listing.
