# Airbnb Case Study
Coursera Research Project

## ASK
###### Understand the business requirements.

### Overview
The team at Airbnb is trying to increase their profits from their rentals across the US. To do this, they want to explore what factors encourage renters to pay more for a particular listing. Is it the location? Walkability? The property's ratings? 

They want you to provide insights and recommendations by analyzing a dataset containing information on current rental prices, rental locations, and a slew of other details. The team will use your analysis in the future to provide property owners with a suggested price to charge renters. This feature will help hosts (and Airbnb) maximize their profits from each listing. 

### Business Objectives
- Explore the prices of current Airbnb listings
- Determine important factors that may influence the price of listings
- Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

### Business Task
My task, as an entry-level analyst, will be to conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the pricing of rentals on Airbnb. To do this, you will load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using the dataset provided.

In this project, we'll use data from Airbnb's New York City dataset (attached below); however, to keep this project unique and open-ended, please feel free to choose whichever major city and datasets you'd prefer - which can be found from Inside Airbnb data.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings.

### Timeframe
Recommendations including report and dashboard are to be delivered by Jan. 12, 2023

## Initial thoughts and Assumptions

- Listings located in Manhattan will have higher average prices.
- Entire home/apt listings should have higher prices compared to single rooms.
- Having more reviews implies higher occupancy or demand which should correlate to its price.
